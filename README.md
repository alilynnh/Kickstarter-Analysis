# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project

### Background
The client for this project was an up-and-coming playwright who wanted to create a crowdfunding campaign titled "Fever". In order to determine a budget for the client's campaign, data from previous crowdfunding campaigns was analyzed. Once a budget was set, the client successfully raised the goal amount in a short period of time.  
### Purpose
The purpose of the current project was to analyze the previous campaign data in order to compare the campaign outcomes in relation to their respective launch dates and monetary goals. The results of the analysis can be used by the client to make informed decisions about their future ventures, as well as compare their results to other campaigns.
